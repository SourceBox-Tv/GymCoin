# Blockchain.io Beta Build
[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5b9cb5e646824741882cdbdb5479840d)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/CoderHubs/GymCoin/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=CoderHubs/GymCoin&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) 

This is GymCoin, the world first blockchain with website mining. You don't need a big computer, or a fancy graphics card to mine!("But of course mining with good computer increases hash rate you just need some decent pc"). With just a browser and some time, you'll be able to earn GymCoin! Note: It could also take up to 10 minutes to mine depending on the code. This is a big project made possible by CoderHub, and we are not responsible for any loss of your coins. Users must read cryptocurrency policy before buying or using GymCoin.

**_This will later become a public mining server website and we would be first organization to do that_**

<h5> Use pip install -r to install requirements.txt</h5>

<p> This is used to install dependencies on your system.</p><p>Note there are some enviorments are listed near this description they dont work we are trying to clear them out.</p>

We are also making company called [Blockchain.io](blockchain.io) owned by programmerShourya.

<h4>Thanks Nathan ang and CoderHubs without you gymcoin would not be possible thank you for you support till this date. </h4>
its not completely devloped we need more people to develop just want to be part of it send a message in issues

This blockchain works perfectly on python 3.7 and sometimes on 3.9 rest we don't know it would work some where else
